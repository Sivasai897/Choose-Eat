# Choose to Eat
Humans tend to establish better and more comfortable lifestyles in the age of information technology. Wireless technology has already established itself as a critical component of a wide range of gadgets and other technologies. Users benefit from the benefits given by wireless technology because they have more control.

Wireless technology is now present in practically all modern gadgets. This information demonstrates the technology's importance and benefits. As a result, we plan to create an application called ChooseEat.

This application was created in Python using the Django framework to provide users with a genuine experience.We utilised Visual Studio Code as a text editor and compiler to work on the code.
# What is ChooseEat
Users may order meals from local eateries or food cooperatives using the ChooseEat website. Many of these, like purchasing consumer products online, allow users to create accounts with them to make future ordering easier. A consumer will look for a preferred restaurant, generally categorised by cuisine, and then choose items from the menu before placing an order.

ChooseEat's major goal is to keep track of food products, categories, customers, orders, and confirmations. It keeps track of all food items, payments, and confirmed orders.
Because the project is entirely administrative, only the administrator has access to add eateries, which helps to limit disciplinary measures. The goal of the project is to create an application software that will minimise the amount of time spent manually handling food items, categories, payments, and customers. It keeps track of all the information about the customer, the order, and the confirmation of the order.

The following are some of ChooseEat's features:

Provides search capabilities based on a variety of criteria. Food Item, Customer, Order, Confirm Order, and so forth.

Shows the customer's details and description for the Food Item.

To improve the efficiency of the Food Item, Category management.

The ability to edit, add, and update records has been increased, resulting in better resource management of Food Item data.
